First notes file for this year. The problems so far have been pretty simple. Which is nice since I'm getting back into C++

This one was also fairly straightforward, with just some string manupulation required. For part one, I was able to use the handy push_back and pop_back functions that come with a c++ standard string that make them behave essentially like a stack, which was exactly what I needed for this problem. And for part two, I had to replace it with doing a substring since we wanted to keep the order.
