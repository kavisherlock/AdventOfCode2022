Lots of string manipulation with this one, to get the actual values out of the input. I started by creating a class for each monkey to store the various values, but then went further by adding methods for each step in each round for a monkey, like performing operations and testing for divisibility. This made writing the actual code for part one much easier. The only tricky part when I was dealing with the actual input was realising the numbers go beyond what fits in an int and using unsigned longs

However, part two, the numbers were gonna go way way beyond unsigned longs, given we're no longer dividing by three at each step. As I was trying to think of a solution by seeing if dividing by the test divisors changes the answer, it took me a few minutes to realise that if I take the remainder of each item when divided by the product of all the divisors, then the tests for each monkey will still have the same results. And that way, I can greatly reduce the item values. And it worked!
