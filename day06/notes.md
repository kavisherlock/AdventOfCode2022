Initially, this problem seemed quite simple. All I had to do was take subsequent substrings of length 4 from the datastream, check if all characters are different and return the index we find such a substring. However, I wanted to find a better solution than to compare all four characters with each other manually. Somehow, I had a feeling part two was gonna simply up the number of characters of the substring that needs to have unique charaters. And while with 4 characters is only 6 comparisons, with, say, 16 characters, there'll be a whopping 120 comparisons.

So I found a better, much simpler solution. Just measure the character counts of the strings seen so far, and at each step, check if any go above 2. This works for four characters. And works for 16. And guess what. I called it. Part two indeed upped the number of charaters to 14. And the only code change required in my file was the constant I had defined at the top for the length of the marker :)
