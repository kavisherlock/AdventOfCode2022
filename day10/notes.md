First impressions, I skimmed through it, say addx and noop and immediately thought Intcode, which, ngl, scared me a little. However, I was relieved to see, it was much simpler. We just had one register and we were just adding values to it and counting cycles. The only tricky bit was understanding when a step needs to happen. For example, in part one, the "signal strength" needed to be taken at the end of the cycle (therefore incrementing the cycle number) but before the operation was done (before x was changed). However, in part two, the pixel change happened during the cycle (therefore not incrementing the cycle). But overall, not much else to worry about
