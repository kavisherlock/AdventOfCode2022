Part one of the problem felt fairly straightforward. All I had to do was move the Head and write the logic to move the Tail accordingly. The rubber-banding effect of the tail meant basically that if at any point the Tail is two away in terms of rows or columns, it goes one closer in that dimension and becomes the same in the other dimension. Otherwise, it just follows the head around.

Part two was daunting at first until I realised that actually, the fact that there's nine knots behind the head doesn't make a difference since one knot will follow its predecessor exactly like the tail followed the head in part one. So all I had to do was write a loop and after moving the head, execute it such that they all move one by one. The only difference was, unlike the head, the other knots can move diagonally. Therefore a few extra situations needed to be handled but then this was done as well
