Sometimes the simple solution is just staring at you in the face. And you decide to reject it and try to be clever. And sometimes you pay for it haha

The simple solution to this problem was, for each tree, look left, up, down and right and see if you encounter any tree the same size or bigger. If you don't, that tree is visible. End of story. But, my clever little mind thought, that's a O(n^3) solution. Bet I could do some clever bits and limit it to O(n^2). And so I went at it, thinking about finding the tallest trees in the row/column. And then checking left and right of it with the edges, knowing the trees between the tallest trees are all invisible. Had to handle a few edge cases. And viola. O(n^2) achieved. And it gave the wrong answer. Why? Because I wasn't checking the sizes of trees other than the tallest and edge trees. Once I did that, I got the answer, but the solution was only slight more efficient that O(n^3), and in fact, in worse-case, it was O(n^3). And the code was extremely confusing.

And for the first time, I did not copy the file from part 1 to part 2. Because the code was completely useless in finding part two's soluition. Instead, I made a fresh one and implemented the simple solution. Took 10 minutes and I got the right answer. Took that file back to part one, just to try implementing the simple solution for it. Took 2 minutes and I got the right answer. That's what I get for trying to be needlessly clever.
